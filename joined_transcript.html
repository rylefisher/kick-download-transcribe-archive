        <div> But it's true. She has so much money. She could have looked fucking 10 out of 10 every single day But instead she's really correct. I don't understand why It's like if she's this isn't she's not a human. This is in human behavior. It's just bizarre. This is it. I think this is it It's like she doesn't chew She just the hell is she's a chicken pop pie That's not even passers-to-chicken pop pie God That's not what you can do I just think that we have to like allow a little bit more wiggle room for like other types of relationships to exist I think most people got to allow for a very standard heterosexual relationship where the man is leading makes more money That's true. That is I remember this all started because I just don't buy amran saying That makes 50k for you. I guess I'm just more realistic Okay, we caught up to where I think the time stamp was like a minute off for something So we caught up that that was her whole rant on like evo psych. Why doesn't work stick  then like, you're used to because I know that nobody makes more money than me. So what do I want to just date really all see the case? Then why are you single? Oh, there he is. How's it going now? Say that is probably true. Like every only fans girl I know, like the boyfriend is kind of maybe had like a normal job before. But now it's like managing them, taking the photos, running their accounts in pretty much every instance I know of. I wouldn't say that we're all losers. A lot of them just had normal jobs that they ended up quitting to basically go into the business with them. Fair enough. Because they make a lot more money when that happens. Yeah. Fair enough. What's up, boggy? First time on the stream here for the. Yeah, I can't stand for super long. I got to bounce here soon. But I just want to say, why would you go on fresh and fit in 2025? Their show is just a fraction of what it used to be. It just seems like a waste of time. Does she really get any exposure going in here and talking for like 10 minutes? I don't think so. No.  I don't even find any fans if you don't know any fans. I thought it's totally fucking worthless I mean even for Amaranth like how many new eyes is Amaranth getting like going on here? And it's terrible optics too because they're like the most demonetized, you know fucking losers going Well, yeah, you look at Myron's Twitter and it's like I'm surprised they're even able to get guests like Amaranth on It's just I don't even know hold on wait, we have to show I'll give a clip But I don't know if you know this in the Amaranth may not disagree Amaranth may not disagree with my games as much as you think oh really hold on Yeah, hold on you might not have seen this clip yet, okay? He's just it's got a lot of good ideas going in here right off the back a lot of bad shit happened in the Holocaust And I don't think the Jewish people in general deserved that kind of torture. That's like totally fair, right? Like that shit happened the Holocaust Jewish people didn't deserve that torture But at the same time the act of getting people out of your country if you don't think they should be there as a leader I agree with you know, it's just  Listen, you just bad tactics, not bad goals, right? And that cleansing is fine, right? It doesn't get better, actually. It literally does not get better. I agree with, like, if they're illegal or whatever. I mean, I don't know. It was a line that kind of crossed it, but for a while there, you know. There was a line that kind of crossed it. But for a while there, okay? Right at the beginning. Well, it was the idea when people are like, this is like the Nazis. Like, I mean, sure, the first part. But what do you think? You think that just because we're getting people out of the country means that we're going to torture them? I would say being in the country is the kind of torture. These people don't look happy here. That's basically cleansing by being nice. Be like, please leave my country. Yeah, that happens. What's the fuck? That's like comparing the Dresden bombing to genocide. You are aware why we were bombing them then, right? They were the Nazis. Yeah. Wow, wow. Yeah, so that clip. Listen.  She might have just wanted to meet one of her heroes. That's why she's on the podcast now, okay? I think so. You know, it's like when you make a certain amount of money, she's made like what, $50 million in only fans, whatever, and now she just doesn't give a fuck. She's on her Kanye shit. She's just saying crazy shit for attention. That's just, you know, you reach a certain amount of money. You're just like, who cares? This is so funny. This is like the third on Hinge Jamer on the clip. I've seen on Twitter. She's been going off. Yeah, I don't know what it is. She like, she just streams 12 hours a day, like not really putting any effort into the content. Like she is just, I don't want to say this to like, fuck. There's like, I don't know if you've ever seen these people argue. There are people who will just stream like 14 hours a day and they won't do content. It'll just be them being like depressed at their computers, like watching videos. And I feel like Amrath does that content as somebody with all the money in the world and like who is, you know, attractive or whatever. I feel like the plastic surgeries may be a little, like off-putting, but like she is attractive. She could go do other things, but she just like AFK is in front of a computer screen for 12 hours a day. I don't know what.  I don't think she's had anything done to her face. She just boobs, I think. Her face just looks like that. But she doesn't do like hot touch anymore. No, like literally if I, if I go to like her channel, she's live right now watching Asmond Gold, right? Interesting. Oh no. She's just here like all day doing this, like AFK in front of the computer screen. I don't know why this just crashed. This tab just crashed entirely. Cool. Love to see it. Anyway, yes, like 12 hours a day, it's crazy. I changed streamers from 10 to 12 hours a day. And how do I have time to suck a man's dick in order to keep them happy? Until 12 hours in the day, 12 extra hours after that. After that stream. I mean, that's some point. Man, I've got no other time stamps on this. You guys want to keep going and watch through Look for air day content. Or do we want to go on to the stream right? Do try the off to stream. Yeah, the one that was like left on, try that shit. Maybe they are a bit loose off camera, you know? Possibly. Do they realize it's being streamed? This is like a secret. Amaran just fucks them all over. Yeah, Amaran has your camera set up. But yeah, I don't know what you mean, Quim and like that.  might not even like they might have said okay but just totally forgotten she was doing it right because they just did a whole stream themselves yeah yeah yeah I can see that this audio is going to be so that's why she's here she's like setting up the next one she wants to be there she is ruthless yes so by some camhosh slaves range you take  Yeah, we met her last month in Dallas, so we were going to kind of meet up with her for two years. Let me do it. Hey, you, this is really crossing another line mentioning Dresden. What line? What are you on about? Yeah. Hey, man. Agi, you guys got thoughts with the Dresden bombings? A war crime? Yes, no? No. Yeah. Yeah. It was after that. That was the bombing. It was after they surrendered, right? No. No, I don't think so. Was it? Was it not? No. My history started. I'm pretty sure. Yeah, there wasn't even dead yet. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was just like one of the main hearts of like German production, like left. So they just, they've on the shit out of it. I'm pretty sure. Pretty sure. I legitimately don't really know. I just been getting Kelly to say that it's not for a long time, because I know it baits people and getting mad. It's also like a honest defeat. Yeah. If they wanted to talk to these girls, you're like, just like that. Oh my, Kelly's going to kill me. Now, Kelly read the Wikipedia article. I don't know anything. Okay, Kelly actually looked it up. I said, I watched, yeah, a fucking documentary show. Read a Wikipedia article. Okay.  Yeah, it feels like it's not supposed to be live. Yeah, like there's a lot of play back speed up. Well, they I can, but they're about to leave. Yeah, something in a way. So there's no way. Is that a fuck the going back and kick player? This girl, I'm trying to see if this girl, that's not one of the girls from the Zerka videos is it? Because if you guys remember correctly, the Zerka pedophile videos, the Zerka heel mic pedophile videos, where they're like talking to those girls and they're not sure what age they are, those, one of those girls works for, worked for fresh and fit. So I'm trying to like, I don't know if I don't think that's one of them, not for a second and it's going up on your own for you. Sorry. All right, here we go. The porn start? No, different ones where they were like, oh, they were doing  like dating content Miami. I'm being told that every night and amaranth sit down and eat together like one hour into the vlog. Yeah, yeah. No, I've got. Oh, okay. I'm trying to dox fresh and fit like I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. It's joke. Are you good? It's a joke. Is it that? I just went on here. Are you dying in here right now? Yeah. It's a job. Cool. Like it's yes? Yes. She's got it locked down. That was mine. You know how hard work it takes. Oh, wait, no, you do. Yeah. I bring the girls like my shirt at the point. So it's like, you know, like trust me. I'm your guys 10. Do you remember what something you can put in that trucker? Are you going to do the back? I mean, you're going to just take this for a second. I had no idea how long it was just keep going. I was like, we're here for the one more, I guess. What? It was you. It was not just me. Yes, it was you. Me and my run of going back before my face. No, no, but it was you though. How? I was asking him questions. The show. It was back. And it was you. And it was you. And it was me. Excuse me. At home. And I'm not annoying. Excuse me. Start. Yes. To be fair, I agree. Yes. I think my run probably took. To a.  part of you though, like you're smiling and shit. She's like, oh my god. I remember when we talked two to three times more than I did. I agree that I reached a lot, but I asked him a lot of questions. Yeah. Yeah. I think just most of the people aren't used to women having anything to say this. I mean, what? I haven't seen much of it for like four so long. You're saying that? Oh, my gosh. Sorry. Every single time I, like, did you guys have to remember, chatters are not the same thing as viewers. Yeah, chatters are, except you guys are. Queenie, you want to tell us the difference between chatters and viewers? You know it, right? I've heard it at least two to three times now. What? This phrase, this expression, the air that gives. Yes. I don't remember. I don't remember. Oh, I'm pretty confident. It's like, chatters are way more engaged. They're not most of your viewership. You shouldn't listen to chatters and like them telling you that you're annoying or bad because they're kind of like basically all chatters are haters. The only reason somebody would chat is because they have like an unhealthy engagement in their haters. That's like the direction she goes in, right? But your viewers aren't your chatters. So you should never listen to your chatters. They're not a good representation of your overall viewer base. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just a way to write off any negative things.  was saying, but yes. Yes. Yeah, people are like crazy. What's ever going on or whatever. There's very few haters on most streams. Well, yeah, because the content creator is the ability to just remove them. Yeah, right. Someone's getting on an injury. You should be like, get out of here. Bye-bye. So, yeah, I would say. Are you not even know what like a booming chat even looks like? Does anybody even tune into her? I mean, this is a question I had in chat. Like, who watches her? I don't understand. I think she gets like when she goes live, she gets like 500 viewers or something. Okay. She has like a decent little audience, but it's like. Hey, it's, it's, you know, so let's be careful. It's these in-sell castoffs and DGG that are just looking for like psychology content that will make them feel like they're improving their miserable situation in some way without actually putting effort in. And she's like a play-cating female voice that tells them it's not their fault they're in in-sell and, you know, whatever. That is really rough on you guys. Okay. Do you guys have to remember that chatters are not the same thing as viewers. Yeah, chatters are, except you guys are in. Except you guys.  All right, so we were like in super chats in 2021. Yeah, the world in the U.S. The speed beat us. Oh, really? Speed like speed was like second to us. And then and then and I got like who's that actual speed? I was in like he just I talked about your super chats. You got in 2022, bro. It's not 2022 anymore. Okay, that's Coke. I think we're gonna skip the next timestamp, which is about our hour in for us to sit down and eat. We got any comments here. Feel like you got keen insight into this kind of thing. It's kind of conversation into what it's welcome. I think what did she say? I didn't hear it. Okay. Everybody knows. I don't know what that's exactly. The tiniest thing. I'm sure the numbers are also different during the times, you know, like world war. So I would you're going or what you say?  It's totally significant. I know. But I mean, it's that he's in the Broncos with Spider-Rose Whitfield. And the North of Austin, you're like, that's 30 minutes with him saying, Tony, bro. It's a movement also that's in Tony, but that's all right. Your Google Maxing is incredibly, I know that, Peter. You step on. OK. How do you make as much money as Amaranth does and have this audio set up? I'm not 100% sure. I want to say that she's got like a camera guy. I thought she had a camera guy when she went to anything else for the politics podcast. Like, you don't just have a couple of little blow-tooth mics with you like that you can just have holding like. She doesn't have to set them up. She just be like, here's like 2% of my daily income to some random dude. And he would set them all up for her. She just had to press the button. Yeah. I just thought it makes no sense here. Someone points out that most of the viewership's not really watching with the sound on a lot of time. How far is your phone going? For hours. And it's on my 35. It's literally like not in the whole country, but it has the same kind of vibe. It's really expensive, but like the river, it goes through.  like there's a whole lot of those bands. Maybe they can be heard at the same archives, which is the next thing to see, going to our Boston and what's to see it is. Let's turn this back up. That Bruno, what? The Bruno guy's like, you guys think of my husband and the boss up. Oh, he doesn't seem so there. I said that back up. Like, no, wait, the Bruno guy, who talked about being like down the river, how could take you when you're like, okay. He's like, that name is what? He's at first being like, you know what my husband, he goes like, obviously, he's just like, he's rock-full. Oh, so he was like, he was like an unironic, like, Hollywood, you're like, I'm like, oh, you know what I'm saying? He's like, do you guys think my husband's ugly, be honest? Yeah. But he just wanted, I don't know what we need to provide him to. You're like, dirty, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, fat, fuck, no one would ever want to have sex with him. Like, yeah. She's so weird. Oh, what is happening? She's so fucking weird. I'm really honest. Everyone in this frame is weird. So that's maybe why they're tolerating it. My God.  Play the Wolf clip. You know, you're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay? I don't see there. I'm not like, there's like an enumerate number of reasons why I've disliked her. Okay? That's nothing to do with fucking jealousy. And I'm quite direct. I read phones, you know? So when she, why don't you try to talk to me at BlizzCon like, I want to say it was like 27, 20, 18, I was like, I just can fully blink to ignore this. But you're regretting that now. I've got to hurry up. Well, no, she was pretty popular but I don't care, like, why would I? Is that supposed to make me like them just because as they become rich. Rich.  whatever. She can't come out here defending the girl who like pretends she sucks real dicks, and then it's plastic dicks. My equipment. That's, that's not enough for yourself to come. What the fuck is that? That's ripping off the insults. Okay. You are paying for porn. Wait, wait, wait, you're totally fine. Just because, just because people are retarded, you're probably... Yeah, same a crypt, I shit. Like, coffee's all about sucks. Nothing to do with why I dislike her, by the way. She can suck plastic dicks while she likes, it's like, whatever. It's a scam. It's fundamentally, I don't like dishonesty, okay? Fundamentally not a fan of dishonesty. You all covered that gamer from Mars video while ago, where it was he was talking about her in that whole arc where she pretended, or allegedly pretended that she was like being abused by her ex-husband. What do you all think about that? I remember watching at the time, but I never actually had like a fun conclusion about what happened there. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't watch the, I didn't watch the gamer from Mars video, but I did watch like, yeah, them going through it at the time, and I, I remember there were some weird things, but also, I think I watched it through like a dusty stream. So now,  you know it was a woman like claiming abuse so I feel like there's every reason for him to discount that. Now I'm thinking wait maybe I should go back and rewatch. Yeah it doesn't really like when they talk about that but no Gamer from Mars put out this video like very recently just kind of renegurgitating all that old shit or whatever and I remember I had like a bunch of people message me like back when that story was breaking they were like Amarant it's a scam like I knew her in high school. It messes me into watching like skit so shit about how like everything she's ever done in her entire career is a lie or whatever so her she was 100% faking abuse but I mean it was stuff with like no evidence so I don't really ever cover it but yeah apparently there's like a lot of like strange lore around her with that situation. I just don't like how she's treated multiple of my friends it's not more deep than that. What should we see?</div>

I was asking him questions. The show. It was back. And it was you. And it was you. And it was me. Excuse me. At home. And I'm not annoying. Excuse me. Start. Yes. To be fair, I agree. Yes. I think my run probably took. To a.</td><td>0:09:00</td></tr><tr><td> part of you though, like you're smiling and shit. She's like, oh my god. I remember when we talked two to three times more than I did. I agree that I reached a lot, but I asked him a lot of questions. Yeah. Yeah. I think just most of the people aren't used to women having anything to say this. I mean, what? I haven't seen much of it for like four so long. You're saying that? Oh, my gosh. Sorry. Every single time I, like, did you guys have to remember, chatters are not the same thing as viewers. Yeah, chatters are, except you guys are. Queenie, you want to tell us the difference between chatters and viewers? You know it, right? I've heard it at least two to three times now. What? This phrase, this expression, the air that gives. Yes. I don't remember. I don't remember. Oh, I'm pretty confident. It's like, chatters are way more engaged. They're not most of your viewership. You shouldn't listen to chatters and like them telling you that you're annoying or bad because they're kind of like basically all chatters are haters. The only reason somebody would chat is because they have like an unhealthy engagement in their haters. That's like the direction she goes in, right? But your viewers aren't your chatters. So you should never listen to your chatters. They're not a good representation of your overall viewer base. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just a way to write off any negative things.</td><td>0:10:00</td></tr><tr><td> was saying, but yes. Yes. Yeah, people are like crazy. What's ever going on or whatever. There's very few haters on most streams. Well, yeah, because the content creator is the ability to just remove them. Yeah, right. Someone's getting on an injury. You should be like, get out of here. Bye-bye. So, yeah, I would say. Are you not even know what like a booming chat even looks like? Does anybody even tune into her? I mean, this is a question I had in chat. Like, who watches her? I don't understand. I think she gets like when she goes live, she gets like 500 viewers or something. Okay. She has like a decent little audience, but it's like. Hey, it's, it's, you know, so let's be careful. It's these in-sell castoffs and DGG that are just looking for like psychology content that will make them feel like they're improving their miserable situation in some way without actually putting effort in. And she's like a play-cating female voice that tells them it's not their fault they're in in-sell and, you know, whatever. That is really rough on you guys. Okay. Do you guys have to remember that chatters are not the same thing as viewers. Yeah, chatters are, except you guys are in. Except you guys.</td><td>0:11:00</td></tr><tr><td> All right, so we were like in super chats in 2021. Yeah, the world in the U.S. The speed beat us. Oh, really? Speed like speed was like second to us. And then and then and I got like who's that actual speed? I was in like he just I talked about your super chats. You got in 2022, bro. It's not 2022 anymore. Okay, that's Coke. I think we're gonna skip the next timestamp, which is about our hour in for us to sit down and eat. We got any comments here. Feel like you got keen insight into this kind of thing. It's kind of conversation into what it's welcome. I think what did she say? I didn't hear it. Okay. Everybody knows. I don't know what that's exactly. The tiniest thing. I'm sure the numbers are also different during the times, you know, like world war. So I would you're going or what you say?</td><td>0:12:00</td></tr><tr><td> It's totally significant. I know. But I mean, it's that he's in the Broncos with Spider-Rose Whitfield. And the North of Austin, you're like, that's 30 minutes with him saying, Tony, bro. It's a movement also that's in Tony, but that's all right. Your Google Maxing is incredibly, I know that, Peter. You step on. OK. How do you make as much money as Amaranth does and have this audio set up? I'm not 100% sure. I want to say that she's got like a camera guy. I thought she had a camera guy when she went to anything else for the politics podcast. Like, you don't just have a couple of little blow-tooth mics with you like that you can just have holding like. She doesn't have to set them up. She just be like, here's like 2% of my daily income to some random dude. And he would set them all up for her. She just had to press the button. Yeah. I just thought it makes no sense here. Someone points out that most of the viewership's not really watching with the sound on a lot of time. How far is your phone going? For hours. And it's on my 35. It's literally like not in the whole country, but it has the same kind of vibe. It's really expensive, but like the river, it goes through.</td><td>0:13:00</td></tr><tr><td> like there's a whole lot of those bands. Maybe they can be heard at the same archives, which is the next thing to see, going to our Boston and what's to see it is. Let's turn this back up. That Bruno, what? The Bruno guy's like, you guys think of my husband and the boss up. Oh, he doesn't seem so there. I said that back up. Like, no, wait, the Bruno guy, who talked about being like down the river, how could take you when you're like, okay. He's like, that name is what? He's at first being like, you know what my husband, he goes like, obviously, he's just like, he's rock-full. Oh, so he was like, he was like an unironic, like, Hollywood, you're like, I'm like, oh, you know what I'm saying? He's like, do you guys think my husband's ugly, be honest? Yeah. But he just wanted, I don't know what we need to provide him to. You're like, dirty, ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly, fat, fuck, no one would ever want to have sex with him. Like, yeah. She's so weird. Oh, what is happening? She's so fucking weird. I'm really honest. Everyone in this frame is weird. So that's maybe why they're tolerating it. My God.</td><td>0:14:00</td></tr><tr><td> Play the Wolf clip. You know, you're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Okay? I don't see there. I'm not like, there's like an enumerate number of reasons why I've disliked her. Okay? That's nothing to do with fucking jealousy. And I'm quite direct. I read phones, you know? So when she, why don't you try to talk to me at BlizzCon like, I want to say it was like 27, 20, 18, I was like, I just can fully blink to ignore this. But you're regretting that now. I've got to hurry up. Well, no, she was pretty popular but I don't care, like, why would I? Is that supposed to make me like them just because as they become rich. Rich.</td><td>0:15:00</td></tr><tr><td> whatever. She can't come out here defending the girl who like pretends she sucks real dicks, and then it's plastic dicks. My equipment. That's, that's not enough for yourself to come. What the fuck is that? That's ripping off the insults. Okay. You are paying for porn. Wait, wait, wait, you're totally fine. Just because, just because people are retarded, you're probably... Yeah, same a crypt, I shit. Like, coffee's all about sucks. Nothing to do with why I dislike her, by the way. She can suck plastic dicks while she likes, it's like, whatever. It's a scam. It's fundamentally, I don't like dishonesty, okay? Fundamentally not a fan of dishonesty. You all covered that gamer from Mars video while ago, where it was he was talking about her in that whole arc where she pretended, or allegedly pretended that she was like being abused by her ex-husband. What do you all think about that? I remember watching at the time, but I never actually had like a fun conclusion about what happened there. Yeah. Yeah, I didn't watch the, I didn't watch the gamer from Mars video, but I did watch like, yeah, them going through it at the time, and I, I remember there were some weird things, but also, I think I watched it through like a dusty stream. So now,</td><td>0:16:00</td></tr><tr><td> you know it was a woman like claiming abuse so I feel like there's every reason for him to discount that. Now I'm thinking wait maybe I should go back and rewatch. Yeah it doesn't really like when they talk about that but no Gamer from Mars put out this video like very recently just kind of renegurgitating all that old shit or whatever and I remember I had like a bunch of people message me like back when that story was breaking they were like Amarant it's a scam like I knew her in high school. It messes me into watching like skit so shit about how like everything she's ever done in her entire career is a lie or whatever so her she was 100% faking abuse but I mean it was stuff with like no evidence so I don't really ever cover it but yeah apparently there's like a lot of like strange lore around her with that situation. I just don't like how she's treated multiple of my friends it's not more deep than that. What should we see?</td><td>0:17:00</td></tr>
